<h1 align="center"> Organizer API REST</h1>

**Organizer** is an API developed in Flask that provides a platform for organized folder and task management. This API allows users to efficiently structure and manage their tasks, dividing them into folders for better organization and accessibility.

The project implements a layered architecture, which facilitates separation of responsibilities and improves code scalability and maintainability.
